# Service Desk

### Usage

Asset Tracker lets you add a custom field to your Service Desk request forms. In this field, you can select an asset to be associated with your request.

You can pick the asset from:

* your assets \(assets where any of the "User" fields is set to you\)
* reporter's assets
* your primary asset
* any asset in Asset Tracker

An example form with an asset field is shown below:
