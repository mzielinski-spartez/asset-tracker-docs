# Customizing assets list view

When browsing folder or listing search results you can select which fields are to be displayed on the list. Fields \(columns\) set configuration can be stored as **template**. You can have many templates defined and switch between them at any time.  


If you haven't defined any templates yet, you start with **Default** one. You can modify visible columns set by clicking Visible Fields -&gt; Edit templates link.

To select fields drag them to _Selected Fields_ pane. The fields can also be reordered. In order to show item ID in the item list view use the checkbox _Show item ID in details view_.

Your template is saved automatically. After closing the dialog items list view will reflect your fields selection.
