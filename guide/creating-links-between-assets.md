# Creating links between assets

Link is a relationship between two assets. For example a mouse or a display can "belong to" a computer, and a computer can "belong to" user.

This kind of relationship is very useful in asset management. For example - you can see all assets that belong to given user with just one click with Asset Tracker!

Go to one of the two assets which you want to connect with some kind of link and click "+".
