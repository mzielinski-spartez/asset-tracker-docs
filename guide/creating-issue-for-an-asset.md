# Creating issue for an asset

Once you are on the asset's page, you can add Jira issues and associate them with the asset. To do this, find the "+" button in the _Jira Issues_ asset field:

Clicking the button opens the issue creation screen:

When the issue is created, it is automatically linked with the asset. Additionally, the _Asset _custom field in the issue is set to the currently open asset, provided that the custom field is present on the issue creation screen for the project in which issue is created.
