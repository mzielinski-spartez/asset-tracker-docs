# Defining an asset field

Asset Tracker comes with a built-in basic set of asset fields. When default fields are not enough you can easily create a new field. Let's assume that you would like to store an expiration date for each fire extinguisher in your system. To do it first you need to create new asset field and then add it to asset type "Fire Extinguisher". You can do it with a few simple steps.

Go to Administration and in section "Field Types" click "Add Field Type" button.

Set unique field name, field type and label that will be visible to Asset Tracker users. Click "OK" to confirm.

Go to "Asset Types" section and click "Fields" link for "Fire Extinguisher" asset type. Add field "Expiration Date" to your layout just like you did with "Serial Number" on page "[Creating new asset type](creating-new-asset-type.md)".

Click the cog icon on the "Expiration day" section in your layout. Check "Show in Asset Creation", so the field will always appear on asset creation dialog.
