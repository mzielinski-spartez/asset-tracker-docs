# Saved Searches

It is possible to save a [search query](search-query-syntax/) and give it a name. Saved searches are accessible in the left column of the asset browser screen, after clicking the "Searches" link on top of the column.

Saved searches can be personal \("My searches"\) as well as public \("Public searches"\). Public searches can only be added and edited by [Asset Tracker administrators](../how-to/how-to-control-access-to-assets.md).

A little clock icon to the right of the search name marks searches that are [scheduled](scheduled-searches.md)

To add a named search, click the "Save current search" link in "My searches" or "Public searches" sections. 

To edit a search, hover over the search name until you see the pencil icon. Clicking it brings up the context menu that lets you:

* edit the search
* save the currently displayed query string under the selected search name
* delete the search

Additionally, public searches have [scheduling options](scheduled-searches.md) available in their edit dialog.
