# How to control access to assets

Asset Tracker allows limiting access to administration, browsing and editing assets to specified Jira groups. \(See image below\).

In addition to limiting access to Asset Tracker administration and assets, you can also limit who can edit the "Asset" custom field, by ticking the checkbox at the bottom of the page. If the checkbox is ticked, only the users who can edit assets will be able to edit the custom field. For other users this field will be read-only.
