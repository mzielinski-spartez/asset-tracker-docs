### Printing labels

Asset Tracker lets you print labels for your assets. Labels are fully customizable. They can contain:

* QR code of the asset, containing asset's URL
* value of any of the asset's fields
* a static text
* asset ID

All of these can be positioned and sized freely on the label. Multiple label formats can be defined, so that you can print different labels for different item types.

You can print labels for individual asset from the asset page, as seen below.

* define the label dimensions \(in "dots" - 1/300 of an inch\) - in the first section
* define what fields, QR codes and static texts will be displayed on a label - in the second section, where you can also see the rough preview of the label
* print test labels, by providing their numeric IDs and clicking "Print"
