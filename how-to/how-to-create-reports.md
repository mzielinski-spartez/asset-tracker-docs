{% hint style="info" %}
In this document we will use sample data delivered with Asset Tracker. You can import them in Asset Tracker Administration in "Import/Export" section.

Using Asset Tracker, you can easily report your data to CSV format that is compatible with major spreadsheet software including Microsoft Excel®.  Let's assume that you want to create a report containing all computers in your company working on Linux. The report should contain detailed information about CPU - its vendor, model, speed and number of cores. With Asset Tracker you can do it in four simple steps:

### List assets to report

You can either use folder tree or enter query in the "Search for assets" box like on the screen below \(see Search query syntax for details\).

### Pick or create report template

Asset Tracker uses  "Field Templates" to define what fields will be included in reported data. Click "Visible fields" and then "Edit templates". The "Visible Fields Templates" screen will appear.

You can create new template using "+" \(plus\) button. Select fields that will be reported and set their order.
