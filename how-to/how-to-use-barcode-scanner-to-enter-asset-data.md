# How to use barcode scanner to enter asset data

It is possible to use a handheld barcode scanner to enter asset data such as serial numbers, service tags etc. To do that, you need a barcode scanner that is a HID device \(i.e. it emulates a keyboard\).

To enter a barcode value, simply set keyboard focus on a field which you want to populate in asset creation dialog or on the asset edition page and then scan the barcode with the scanner. The field will populate with scanned data.
