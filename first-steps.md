# First steps

## Introduction

Asset Tracker provides visibility of the current state of your equipment. It tracks what devices you have and who is using them. Just like on the image below it's clearly visible which mobile devices are available in the storeroom and who checked the others out.

## Browsing assets

To list available assets go to _Assets_ â†’ _Browse Assets_ as shown on the screenshot below. Assets are grouped in folders. Click the folder that you want to browse form the panel on the left.

## Checking assets out and in

To check an asset out just hover it and click the "Check-out" button. The asset will be assigned to you and its status will be set to "Checked-out".

You can check-in an asset the same way just click the "Check-in" button. It will mark the asset at available and remove the assignment from you.

## Configuring mobile device for check-in / check-out

Asset Tracker provides mobile applications supporting check-in / check-out process. You can learn about this functionality [on this page](how-to/how-to-define-and-execute-pre-packaged-operation-sequences-on-assets/invoking-operation-sequences-by-scanning-asset-label.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
We are currently in the process of redesigning our mobile apps for better support of the check-in / check-out process. Reach us at [support@spartez.com](mailto:support@spartez.com) if you want to participate in our open beta testing program.
