# First steps

## Introduction

Asset Tracker provides visibility of the current state of your equipment. It tracks what devices you have and who is using them. Just like in the image below, it's clearly visible which mobile devices are available in the storeroom, and who has the others checked-out.

## Browsing assets

To list available assets go to _Assets_ â†’ _Browse Assets_ as shown on the screenshot below.   
Asset types are grouped into folders.   
To view specific Asset types, click the folder that you want to browse form the panel on the left.   
\(Folder 'Mobile phones' is selected in the image below\)

## Asset check-out and check-in

To check-out an asset, just hover it and click the "Check-out" button.   
The asset will be assigned to you and its status will be set to "Checked-out".

You can check-in an asset the same way just click the "Check-in" button.   
It will mark the asset as 'Available' and remove the assignment from you.  
i.e. When an Asset is available, there will be no assigned owner.

## Configuring mobile device for check-in / check-out

Asset Tracker provides mobile applications supporting the same check-in / check-out process.   
You can learn about this functionality [on this page](how-to/how-to-define-and-execute-pre-packaged-operation-sequences-on-assets/invoking-operation-sequences-by-scanning-asset-label.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
We are currently in the process of redesigning our mobile apps for better support of the check-in / check-out process.   
Reach us at [support@spartez.com](mailto:support@spartez.com) if you want to participate in our open beta testing program.
