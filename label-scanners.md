# Label scanners

Asset Tracker provides Android and iPhone applications which let you quickly scan [asset labels](https://confluence.spartez.com/display/AT4J/How+to+print+labels+for+assets) containing asset QR code.

Scanning the label with these applications automatically updates the asset record by performing a selected [operation sequences](https://confluence.spartez.com/display/AT4J/How+to+define+and+execute+pre-packaged+operation+sequences+on+assets) or by updating a date field to the current date and time - see [inventory checks](https://confluence.spartez.com/display/AT4J/How+to+perform+inventory+checks).

You can download the label scanning app from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spartez.assettracker.checkin) and the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asset-tracker-label-scanner/id1253900536?l=pl&ls=1&mt=8).
