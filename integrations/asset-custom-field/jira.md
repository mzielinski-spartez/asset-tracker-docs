# Jira

Asset Tracker lets you add an _Asset_ custom field to your issues. The field can be edited on any of the Jira screens. When setting the value of an asset in this field, you can pick it from:

* your assets \(assets where any of the "User" fields is set to you\)
* reporter's assets
* assignee's assets
* assets of a user set in any "userpicker" Jira custom field
* your primary asset
* any asset in Asset Tracker

When an asset is set in the custom field, Asset Tracker also adds a link from the issue to the asset in the _Issue Links_ section of the issue screen.

When browsing for an asset to set in the field, you can browse all assets in Asset Tracker and perform [searches](../../searching/search-query-syntax/) for assets that you are interested in, as shown below.
